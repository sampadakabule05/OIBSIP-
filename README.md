# Iris Flower Classification

## Problem Statement

Classify iris flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica species based on sepal and petal measurements.

## Approach

- Used the Iris dataset with SepalLength, SepalWidth, PetalLength, PetalWidth as features.
- Applied Random Forest Classifier from scikit-learn.
- Achieved accuracy of around 95-100%.

## Files

- `iris_classification.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with full code.
- `Iris.csv`: Dataset file.

## How to Run

1. Open `iris_classification.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run all cells step by step.
3. Ensure required libraries are installed (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, joblib).

## Conclusion

Successfully classified iris flowers using Machine Learning with high accuracy as part of Oasis Infobyte internship task.
