# Sales Prediction

## Overview

This project predicts **sales figures** based on advertising data using **Machine Learning regression models**. It is part of my **Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship** to implement predictive analytics in business datasets.

## Dataset

- **Source:** Standard advertising and sales dataset from Kaggle or UCI.
- Contains features such as **TV, Radio, Newspaper advertising spend** and **Sales**.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression
- Jupyter Notebook

## Task Workflow

1. Load and explore dataset
2. Perform data cleaning if required
3. Visualize features vs sales
4. Train regression models (Linear, Decision Tree)
5. Evaluate using R2 Score and Mean Squared Error
6. Predict sales based on input features
7. Save trained model using joblib

## Installation

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn joblib matplotlib seaborn
